# What's here?

Very basic cdk stack with lambda and api gateway.

# Demo

```bash
npm run init # After clone init all 3rd parties
npm run build # Build application
npm run deploy # Deploy stack
npm run demo # Make demo request
npm run destroy # Destroy stack
npm run clear # Clear all local files (build, cdk data, node_modules)
```

Or run all

npm run full
```
